# WordPress Boilerplate

A simplified WordPress theme boilerplate to save your time. I'm using [gulp.js](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) and es2015.  

With gulp.js, I'm using [gulp-connect](https://github.com/AveVlad/gulp-connect) to create a live server with hot reload to preview the static assets (css/js).  

Also, with [gulp-fn](https://github.com/ThierrySpetebroot/gulp-fn) I'm dynamically appending to the compiled css the banner required by Wordpress.


### Dev stuff
```bash
# install dependencies
yarn


# serve with hot reload at localhost:9567
gulp
```


### Disclaimer

This boilerplate was originally created by my bud [@koganas](https://github.com/koganas) - I just added some utilities.  

Feel free to use, improve and share it!
